    <p class="lyrics">
      I had all and then most of you<br>
      Some and now none of you<br>
      Take me back to the night we met<br>
      I don't know what I'm supposed to do<br>
      Haunted by the ghost of you<br>
      Oh, take me back to the night we met<br>
      When the night was full of terrors<br>
      And your eyes were filled with tears
